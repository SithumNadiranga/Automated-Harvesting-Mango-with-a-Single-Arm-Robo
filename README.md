# INTRODUCTION 
* Automated Harvesting Mango with a Single Arm Robot using MATLAB, Simulink, and SolidWorks.
* Developed an automated mango harvesting system using a KUKA KR 16 robotic arm integrated with Faster YOLO
  for real-time fruit detection and RGB cameras for precise localization. The robot efficiently detects, picks, and
  stores mangoes with minimal damage, addressing labor shortages and improving agricultural productivity through
  advanced robotics and AI.
